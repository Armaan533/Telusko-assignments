##Annotations

Annotations in java are the tags which are used to give a class, interface, method or a field more information.
For example:
```java
@Deprecated
public void A(){
}
```
This tag, `@Deprecated`, tells the compiler and also the programmer that this method is deprecated and should not be used.
